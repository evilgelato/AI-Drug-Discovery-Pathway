📅 Month 4 – Cross-Functional Project Simulation
🎯 Goals

Demonstrate project management skills (roadmaps, risks, dependencies).

Simulate leading a cross-functional R&D project.

Deliver a structured plan + roadmap you can share in interviews/portfolio.

Step 1: Learn Project Tools & Approaches (Week 1)

Familiarize with tools used in pharma informatics:

Smartsheet (roadmapping, dependencies).

JIRA (tasks, sprints).

Confluence (documentation).

Training Resources:

Smartsheet’s free project management tutorials.

Atlassian University’s “Agile with JIRA” mini-course.

Read up on Roche’s DDC (Data & Digital Catalysts) structure → they emphasize “domains, product families, interdependencies.”

👉 Mini-exercise: Build a 1-page “R&D project lifecycle” template in Smartsheet or Excel with phases (Discovery → Preclinical → Clinical).

Step 2: Define a Mock Project (Week 2)

Choose a project theme relevant to Genentech roles, e.g.:

“From Assay Data to ML-Based Target Prediction.”

Define deliverables for each phase:

Data Collection: Curate assay/omics dataset.

Data Engineering: Build FAIR pipeline (from Month 2).

Model Development: Apply ML model (Month 3 projects).

Deployment: Expose results via web app (Month 5 preview).

Define stakeholders: wet-lab scientists, computational biologists, data engineers, leadership.

👉 Mini-exercise: Write a 1-page project charter (objectives, scope, key stakeholders, timeline).

Step 3: Build the Roadmap & Risk Register (Week 3)

Use Smartsheet or Gantt chart tool to map:

Tasks, dependencies, and milestones.

Example dependencies: assay dataset availability → data pipeline setup → ML model training → deployment.

Create a risk register with:

Risks (e.g., “dataset quality too low,” “model underperforms”).

Mitigation strategies.

Map interdependencies like Roche’s DDC structure (cross-family alignment).

👉 Mini-exercise: Create a visual roadmap with milestones: Data → ML → Validation → Deployment.

Step 4: Write the Project Simulation Report (Week 4)

3–5 page PDF report summarizing:

Objective & Scope.

Roadmap (with diagram).

Dependencies & Risks.

Expected Deliverables.

Stakeholder Communication Plan.

Format it as if you were presenting to Genentech R&D leadership.

Add visuals: timeline chart, stakeholder map, risk matrix.

Deliverables:

Roadmap (Smartsheet, Excel, or PowerPoint timeline).

PDF Report: “Cross-Functional AI-Driven Drug Discovery Project Plan.”

Resume-Ready Bullet Points

“Developed cross-functional roadmap for AI-driven target identification project, aligning assay data engineering, ML model development, and deployment milestones.”

“Built risk register and dependency map simulating R&D project management, demonstrating ability to manage ambiguity and coordinate across technical/scientific stakeholders.”

LinkedIn Post Example

“In addition to building AI/ML models for drug discovery, I’ve been simulating what it means to lead cross-functional projects. I created a roadmap for an end-to-end R&D project — from assay data ingestion to ML-driven target identification — with milestones, risks, and stakeholder alignment. This mirrors the kind of structured planning needed at Genentech and Roche in Data & Digital Catalysts domains.”

🔑 Why Month 4 Matters

Shows leadership + systems thinking, not just technical skill.

Prepares you for interview questions about project ambiguity, dependencies, and stakeholder alignment.

Adds a deliverable (PDF + roadmap) that looks like real work product from a scientist/PM hybrid role.
