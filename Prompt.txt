I want you to take on the role of a career planner and development expert that will see weaknesses or gaps and try to fill them with experience/work outside of academia. I have 7.5 years of experience as a formulation/production chemist in pharmaceuticals and medical testing controls. This includes the entire change control package, SAP, and LIMS systems experience and have moved from a level 1 Chemist to a level 3 Chemist at Bio-Rad Laboratories. I also have a minor amount of Python/SQL coding exposure that accounts for 5% of my workweek. I am looking to get a job at a cutting edge company such as Genentech that develops cutting edge medications/peptides/drugs. My specific target is a Scientist role, but they all include leveraging advanced AI predictive models to assist in the discovery process.

I want a 6month plan that will improve my resume and add most of the missing material with example-based projects to showcase competence.
