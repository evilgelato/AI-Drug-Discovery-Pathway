📅 Month 2 – Data Pipelines & FAIR Data Practice
🎯 Goals

Learn basics of data pipelines and engineering (ETL: extract, transform, load).

Apply FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable).

Build a pipeline project simulating what’s used in pharma R&D to manage assay data.

Step 1: Learn FAIR & Data Lifecycle Basics (Week 1)

Read/Watch:

ELIXIR FAIR Data webinars (introductory sessions are free on YouTube).

Roche & Novartis whitepapers on FAIR in pharma (FAIRplus project).

Quick summary of FAIR:

Findable: Metadata, unique IDs.

Accessible: APIs, documented formats.

Interoperable: Common standards (CSV, JSON).

Reusable: Clear provenance, licenses, reproducibility.

👉 Small exercise: Write a one-page note on how your current lab processes (SAP/LIMS) already embody or violate FAIR.

Step 2: Data Engineering Foundations (Week 2)

Learn how assay/lab datasets are typically managed:

Use Pandas to clean messy Excel/CSV data (missing values, duplicates).

Practice loading data into SQLite (simple relational database).

Write SQL queries to summarize results (e.g., mean assay signal per compound).

Tools to set up:

sqlite3, sqlalchemy, pandas, fastapi.

👉 Small exercise: Take any experimental dataset (Excel from Kaggle if needed), load it into SQLite, and run queries for basic stats.

Step 3: Pipeline Project – FAIR-Compliant Assay Data Manager (Weeks 3–4)

Objective: Simulate what a pharma informatics team does with assay results.

Steps:

Extract: Load assay data (CSV/Excel).

Transform: Clean, normalize column names, add metadata (date, analyst, assay type).

Load: Store results in SQLite.

Access: Build a simple API using FastAPI so a user can query assay results (e.g., compound ID → return values).

FAIR Compliance:

Assign UUIDs to datasets.

Add metadata.json (date, creator, version).

Document reproducibility steps.

Stretch goal: Add a small dashboard (Streamlit) to visualize assay results by compound.

Step 4: Packaging & Resume-Ready Deliverable

GitHub repo with:

README.md explaining pipeline and FAIR principles.

Jupyter notebook with ETL steps.

SQLite database + FastAPI script.

Metadata JSON file (example of FAIR).

Resume bullet example:

“Built a FAIR-compliant assay data pipeline integrating CSV ingestion, data cleaning, SQLite storage, and FastAPI query endpoints, demonstrating reproducible R&D data management practices.”

LinkedIn post idea:

“In drug discovery, data integrity is everything. I built a FAIR-compliant pipeline for assay data — integrating ETL, metadata, and APIs — to simulate how R&D teams ensure findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable datasets.”

🔑 Why Month 2 Matters

FAIR expertise is now a requirement at Genentech/Roche.

This project shows you can do more than “analysis” — you can design reproducible data systems.

Demonstrates cross-functionality: chemist + data engineer hybrid skillset.
