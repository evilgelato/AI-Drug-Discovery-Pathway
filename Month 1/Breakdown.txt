📅 Month 1 – Foundations in AI for Drug Discovery
🎯 Goals




Build core competency in AI/ML as applied to biology & chemistry.

Get comfortable with cheminformatics tools like RDKit.

Complete one project that demonstrates value in a drug discovery context.

Step 1: Learn the Basics (Week 1)

AI for Medicine Specialization (Coursera, DeepLearning.AI) → pick the first course only: AI for Medical Diagnosis. (~10 hrs).

You’ll learn about data preprocessing, model evaluation, and interpretability in a medical context.

Install Tools:

Python (Anaconda recommended).

Jupyter Notebooks.

Packages: rdkit, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib.

Dataset: download a ChEMBL subset (e.g., 5,000–10,000 molecules with drug-likeness/activity labels).







Step 2: Cheminformatics Foundations (Week 2)

Learn how to handle chemical data:

SMILES strings → how molecules are encoded as text.

Calculate descriptors: LogP, TPSA, molecular weight, number of H-bond donors/acceptors.

Visualize a few molecules from SMILES in RDKit.

👉 Small exercise: Take 10 random molecules, calculate descriptors, and make a scatter plot (MW vs LogP).





tep 3: First AI Project – Predicting Drug-Likeness (Weeks 3–4)

Objective: Train a simple ML model that predicts whether a molecule is “drug-like.”

Steps:

Load dataset (SMILES + drug-likeness labels).

Use RDKit to compute descriptors (LogP, TPSA, MW, #rotatable bonds).

Train a classifier (Random Forest or Logistic Regression).

Evaluate performance with ROC-AUC and confusion matrix.

Document clearly: problem → dataset → features → model → results.

Stretch goal: Visualize “drug-like” vs “non-drug-like” molecules on a 2D PCA plot.





Step 4: Packaging & Resume-Ready Deliverable

Put the notebook on GitHub with:

README (explain drug-likeness concept, project steps, and results).

Requirements.txt.

Write a short LinkedIn post:

“I’ve just completed my first cheminformatics + AI project: predicting drug-likeness using molecular descriptors from ChEMBL and a machine learning classifier. Excited to keep bridging chemistry and AI for drug discovery 🚀”

🔑 Why this is the Best Start Point

Low barrier, high visibility: You’ll get hands-on coding without requiring a PhD in ML.

Directly relevant: Shows you can apply AI to real biological/chemical problems.

Deliverable-focused: One GitHub project = one concrete resume bullet.
