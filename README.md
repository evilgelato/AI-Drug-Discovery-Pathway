# AI-Drug-Discovery-Pathway
Goal of this Pathway is to follow a self-made programmatic approach to learning Drug Discovery and its tools while building a showcase of applied projects



# """

Got it ‚Äî you want a 6-month career development plan that takes you from your current background (Formulation/Production Chemist with SAP/LIMS, change controls, and light coding) to being competitive for a Scientist role at a cutting-edge company like Genentech, where the emphasis is on AI-enabled drug discovery, translational biology, and advanced data science.

Here‚Äôs a structured plan that blends technical upskilling, project experience, and resume-ready deliverables to close your biggest gaps:

üìÖ Six-Month Career Development Plan
Month 1: Foundations in AI + Drug Discovery

Goal: Build baseline knowledge in AI/ML applied to biology, establish credibility in data science basics.

Coursework/Training:

Coursera/DeepLearning.AI: AI for Medicine Specialization (diagnosis, prognosis, treatment effect).

Intro to Cheminformatics (RDKit tutorials).

Genentech-aligned reading: FAIR data principles, basics of protein‚Äìligand binding.

Projects (resume-ready):

Write a Python notebook using RDKit to calculate molecular descriptors (LogP, MW, TPSA) for a small molecule dataset (e.g., ChEMBL subset).

Use scikit-learn to build a classifier that predicts drug-likeness from descriptors.

Deliverable: GitHub repo + LinkedIn post demonstrating "Predicting Drug-Likeness Using Machine Learning".






Month 2: Data Pipelines & FAIR Data Practice

Goal: Show capability in data wrangling and compliance principles used in Pharma R&D.

Coursework:

Data Engineering basics (ETL pipelines with Python/SQL).

FAIR data/metadata principles (ELIXIR webinars or Roche open resources).

Projects:

Build a small data pipeline that ingests assay results (CSV/Excel), stores them in SQLite, and exposes them via a clean API (Flask/FastAPI).

Apply FAIR principles: metadata tagging, version control, reproducibility.

Deliverable: "FAIR-compliant Data Pipeline for Assay Results" with README describing pharmaceutical application.






Month 3: AI Model Application to Biology

Goal: Move from coding exercises to biology-aligned AI projects.

Coursework:

Hugging Face ‚ÄúTransformers for Biomedicine‚Äù tutorials.

Read papers from Roche/Genentech on AI in discovery (MolBERT, AlphaFold, etc.).

Projects:

Fine-tune a pretrained transformer (e.g., BioBERT) on protein sequence classification (binding vs non-binding peptides).

Build a simple Graph Neural Network (PyTorch Geometric) for molecule property prediction.

Deliverable: Case study ‚ÄúApplying Transformers & GNNs to Drug Discovery Tasks‚Äù (GitHub + Medium-style writeup).





Month 4: Cross-Functional Project Simulation

Goal: Demonstrate leadership, project management, and integration of technical + scientific goals.

Activities:

Take a Smartsheet or JIRA project simulation course.

Practice building roadmaps with milestones, risks, dependencies (mirroring the DDC Domain Lead job description).

Project:

Run a mock project: ‚ÄúFrom Assay Data to ML-Based Target Prediction.‚Äù

Phase 1: Ingest and clean dataset.

Phase 2: Build ML model (classification).

Phase 3: Write project plan with risks/dependencies.

Deliverable: PDF report + visual roadmap in Smartsheet (share on portfolio site).






Month 5: Showcase AI/ML Deployment + Collaboration

Goal: Prove ability to bring AI into usable form for research teams.

Coursework:

Learn Docker + model deployment with FastAPI.

Review collaboration case studies in cross-disciplinary AI projects (CBM/TRAIL labs style).

Projects:

Deploy a web app where users upload a molecule (SMILES) and receive predicted solubility or binding probability.

Deliverable: Live demo (Heroku/Streamlit) + GitHub repo.

Resume bullet: ‚ÄúDeveloped and deployed a ML-powered web tool predicting solubility from SMILES input, integrating cheminformatics and web APIs for research usability.‚Äù






Month 6: Capstone + Thought Leadership

Goal: Integrate everything into a visible portfolio aligned to Genentech Scientist expectations.

Capstone Project:

‚ÄúAI-Driven Target Identification Simulation‚Äù:

Integrate protein sequence data + compound data.

Train ML model predicting likelihood of interaction.

Document project plan, risks, FAIR compliance, and deployment.

Networking:

Post each milestone on LinkedIn tagging AI-bio groups.

Attend at least 2 webinars from Roche/Novartis AI/ML discovery teams.

Deliverable:

Full portfolio (GitHub + PDF dossier).

Polished resume with new bullets under ‚ÄòProjects & Technical Contributions‚Äô.

Example bullet: ‚ÄúBuilt end-to-end FAIR-compliant pipeline integrating assay data and ML models, deployed as interactive tool predicting peptide‚Äìprotein binding, demonstrating translational AI applications to drug discovery.‚Äù





üîë Key Gaps You‚Äôll Close

Lack of direct AI/ML biology projects ‚Üí 4‚Äì5 GitHub projects showing drug discovery relevance.

No FAIR/data lifecycle expertise ‚Üí FAIR-compliant pipeline deliverable.

Limited leadership/project management ‚Üí Month 4 roadmap/report project.

Not enough deployment experience ‚Üí Month 5 Streamlit/Heroku app.

Networking/thought leadership gap ‚Üí LinkedIn posts, webinars, portfolio.

üëâ By the end of 6 months, you‚Äôll have a portfolio of applied projects, AI/ML exposure, cross-functional project simulations, and demonstrable FAIR compliance knowledge. That transforms your current profile (Formulation Chemist with SAP/LIMS) into someone Genentech could hire for Scientist roles in AI-enabled discovery.
