📅 Month 6 – Capstone + Thought Leadership
🎯 Goals

Deliver an integrated project applying AI to a biologically meaningful question.

Package your work into a professional portfolio + report.

Establish thought leadership and visibility in AI-enabled drug discovery.

Step 1: Define the Capstone Problem (Week 1)

Pick a problem that connects proteins + small molecules (cross-domain integration is attractive for Genentech):

“AI-Driven Target Identification Simulation”

Example framing: “Can we predict whether a given small molecule will interact with a protein target using integrated ML approaches?”

Data sources:

BindingDB → protein-ligand activity data.

ChEMBL → molecular bioactivity datasets.

UniProt → protein sequence info.

👉 Mini-exercise: Draft a 1-page project proposal (problem, dataset, methods, outcomes).

Step 2: Build the Pipeline (Week 2)

Integrate prior months’ skills into one end-to-end workflow:

Data ingestion: Curate ligand + protein pairs (apply FAIR metadata).

Feature extraction:

Protein sequences → ProtBERT embeddings.

Molecules → graph embeddings (RDKit + GNN).

Model: Concatenate embeddings → train classifier predicting binding likelihood.

Validation: ROC-AUC, precision-recall curves.

👉 Stretch goal: Compare GNN vs descriptor-only models.

Step 3: Deploy & Document (Week 3)

Deliverables:

GitHub repo: all code, Jupyter notebooks, dataset preprocessing scripts.

Streamlit app: user inputs a protein sequence + SMILES → app predicts interaction likelihood.

Metadata: document FAIR compliance (dataset versioning, provenance).

Documentation:

README: problem statement, methodology, results.

3–5 page PDF “Technical Report.”

“User Guide” for scientists.

👉 Mini-exercise: Add diagrams (system architecture, workflow flowchart).

Step 4: Portfolio Packaging (Week 4)

Compile your projects into a professional portfolio:

GitHub “Pinned Repositories” = 4–5 projects (drug-likeness, FAIR pipeline, ProtBERT, GNN, Capstone).

Create a Portfolio PDF (2–3 pages): screenshot + short description for each project.

Upload to LinkedIn as “Featured Project.”

Visibility:

Write a LinkedIn post:

“Over the past 6 months, I’ve built an AI-for-Drug-Discovery portfolio — from cheminformatics to FAIR pipelines to deployed models. My capstone integrates protein + molecule embeddings to predict binding interactions, simulating an end-to-end discovery workflow. Thrilled to share my journey toward translational AI in drug discovery.”

Optional: Publish a blog/Medium post: “Building an AI-Driven Target Identification Tool in 6 Months: A Scientist’s Journey.”

Step 5: Thought Leadership & Networking

Attend at least 2 webinars in computational biology/AI (e.g., Roche’s open seminars, ISMB conference recordings).

Start commenting/posting weekly on LinkedIn in AI-bio spaces.

Reach out to Genentech/Roche scientists on LinkedIn with a short message:

“Hi [Name], I’ve been building an AI-for-Drug-Discovery portfolio (FAIR pipelines, GNNs, protein-ligand classifiers) and would love to connect with others applying AI in translational biology.”

Deliverables at the End of Month 6

✅ GitHub repo with capstone project (protein-ligand prediction pipeline).
✅ Live Streamlit app demo.
✅ PDF dossier (project report + user guide).
✅ Portfolio PDF (highlighting all 6 months of projects).
✅ Thought-leadership presence (LinkedIn posts, blog, networking).

Resume Bullets (Capstone Level)

“Built an end-to-end AI pipeline integrating ProtBERT embeddings of protein sequences and graph neural networks of small molecules to predict ligand–target interactions (ROC-AUC 0.81), simulating a translational drug discovery workflow.”

“Deployed predictive model as interactive Streamlit app with FAIR-compliant dataset management, enabling accessibility for cross-functional research teams.”

“Packaged AI-for-Drug-Discovery portfolio including cheminformatics, FAIR pipelines, and deep learning applications for translational biology.”

🔑 Why Month 6 Matters

You’re no longer just “a chemist who learned Python.” You’re now someone who can lead and deliver translational AI projects.

This capstone bridges wet lab + computational — exactly what Genentech Scientist roles demand.

Your portfolio demonstrates sustained growth + leadership in 6 months, making your career pivot believable.
